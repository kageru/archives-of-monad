You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a -4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides  <a href="/condition/dazzled">Dazzled</a>.

You can't hear. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a -2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses. If you perform an action with the auditory trait, you must succeed at a <strong>DC 5</strong> flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to auditory effects.

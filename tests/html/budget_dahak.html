<b>Smoke Vision</b>
<p>Smoke doesn't impair a red dragon's vision; it ignores the concealed condition from smoke.</p>
<b>Dragon Heat</b> (arcane, aura, evocation, fire)
<p>; 10 feet, 4d6 fire damage</p>
<b>Frightful Presence</b> (aura, emotion, fear, mental)
<p>90 feet, DC 40</p>
<p>A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this monster's Frightful Presence for 1 minute.</p><hr />
<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected by the presence.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is <a href="/condition/frightened">Frightened 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is <a href="/condition/frightened">Frightened 2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is <a href="/condition/frightened">Frightened 4</a>.</p>
<b>Attack of Opportunity</b> <img alt="Reaction" class="actionimage" src="/static/actions/Reaction.webp">
<p>Jaws only.</p>
<p data-visibility="gm"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. <strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>
<b>Redirect Fire</b> <img alt="Reaction" class="actionimage" src="/static/actions/Reaction.webp"> (abjuration, arcane)
<p>; <strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 100 feet casts a fire spell, or a fire spell otherwise comes into effect from a source within 100 feet. <strong>Effect</strong> The dragon makes all the choices to determine the targets, destination, or other effects of the spell, as though it were the caster.</p>
<b>Breath Weapon</b> <img alt="Two Actions" class="actionimage" src="/static/actions/TwoActions.webp"> (arcane, evocation, fire)
<p>The dragon breathes a blast of flame that deals 20d6 fire damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 42 basic Reflex save). It can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<b>Draconic Frenzy</b> <img alt="Two Actions" class="actionimage" src="/static/actions/TwoActions.webp">
<p>The dragon makes two claw Strikes and one wing Strike in any order.</p>
<b>Draconic Momentum</b>
<p>The dragon recharges its Breath Weapon whenever it scores a critical hit with a Strike.</p>
<b>Manipulate Flames</b> <img alt="One Action" class="actionimage" src="/static/actions/OneAction.webp"> (arcane, concentrate, transmutation)
<p>The red dragon attempts to take control of a magical fire or a fire spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modifier +32), the original caster loses control of the spell or magic fire, control is transferred to the dragon, and the dragon counts as having Sustained the Spell with this action (if applicable). The dragon can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if it chooses.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes-only unquestioned fact.</p>
<p>Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.</p>
<p>Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals-or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.</p>
<p>As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.</p>

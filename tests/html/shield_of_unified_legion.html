<h2>Traits</h2>
<div class="trait-legend">
<b>Uncommon</b>
<p>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.</p>
<b>Evocation</b>
<p>Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.</p>
<b>Magical</b>
<p>Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.</p>

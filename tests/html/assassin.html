<h1>Assassin<span class="type">Archetype</span></h1>
<hr/>
<p>Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.</p>

<h2><a href="/feat/angel_of_death">Angel Of Death</a> Feat 10</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Assassin Dedication</p>
<hr />
<p>All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Assassin Dedication</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have designated a mark using Mark for Assassination and are completely unnoticed by your mark.</p>
<hr />
<p>You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes 6d6 extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an incapacitation effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.</p>

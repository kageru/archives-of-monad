<p>Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb deals the listed negative damage and splash damage, and it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage harms only living creatures.</p>
<hr />
<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls</p>
<p>The bomb deals 4d6 negative damage and 4 negative splash damage. On a critical hit, the target is <a href="/condition/sickened">Sickened 4</a>.</p>
<h2>Traits</h2>
<div class="trait-legend">
<b>Common</b>
<p>Anything that doesn't list another rarity trait (uncommon, rare, or unique) automatically has the common trait. This rarity indicates that an ability, item, or spell is available to all players who meet the prerequisites for it. A creature of this rarity is generally known and can be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.</p>
<b>Alchemical</b>
<p>Alchemical items are powered by reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren't magical and don't radiate a magical aura.</p>
<b>Bomb</b>
<p>An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects.</p>
<b>Consumable</b>
<p>An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it's destroyed after activation. Consumable items include alchemical items and magical consumables such as scrolls and talismans. When a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four.</p>
<b>Negative</b>
<p>Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy.</p>
<b>Splash</b>
<p>When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.</p>
